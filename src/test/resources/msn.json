The two others were later convicted but Gavin was not prosecuted, leading to allegations within the gang that he was a Garda informer.</p> \n<div id=\"outstream_article\" data-id=\"166\" data-m=\"{&quot;i&quot;:166,&quot;p&quot;:163,&quot;n&quot;:&quot;article-inlineOutstreamAd&quot;,&quot;t&quot;:&quot;inlineOutstreamAd&quot;,&quot;o&quot;:3}\"> \n <div id=\"inlineoutstreamcontainer\" class=\"inlineOutstreamContainer\"> \n  <script class=\"sdkdapscript\"> require([\"inlineoutstreamAd\", \"c.deferred\"], function(outStreamVideoAd) { outStreamVideoAd(\"&amp;AP=7466700&amp;PG=NEWIEEN16&amp;PVGUID=594ac01c4847445bbe11ac0c6b4f1a5d&amp;PROVIDERID=B6E3VI2I3\", {\"scrollInit\":true,\"enableAdRefresh\":true,\"adaptiveRefresh\":true,\"adaptiveRefreshInterval\":3000,\"prid\":\"B6E3VI2I3\",\"adsVNextHeight\":\"LB\",\"adsVNextWidth\":\"LB\",\"rid\":\"594ac01c4847445bbe11ac0c6b4f1a5d\",\"adtext\":\"Ad\",\"showmute\":true,\"showvolume\":true,\"nonviewablebehavior\":\"pause\",\"showprogressbar\":true,\"allowfullscreen\":true,\"videothreshold\":1,\"videooffset\":5,\"skiplocation\":\"top-left\",\"skiptext\":\"Video can be skipped in %%TIME%% seconds\",\"skipbuttontext\":\"SKIP\",\"autoinitialsize\":false,\"disablecollapse\":false,\"playOnMouseover\":false,\"audioOnMouseover\":\"false\",\"playVideoVisibleThreshold\":50,\"disableTopBar\":false,\"preShowType\":\"none\",\"preShowUrl\":\"\",\"postShowType\":\"\",\"postShowUrl\":\"\",\"postShowClickUrl\":\"\",\"fallbackType\":\"\",\"fallbackUrl\":\"\",\"fallbackClickUrl\":\"\",\"vpaidTimeout\":5000,\"terminateUnresponsiveVPAIDCreative\":false,\"enableInlineVideoForIos\":false,\"delayExpandUntilVPAIDInit\":false,\"delayExpandUntilVPAIDImpression\":false,\"apnId\":280}); }); </script> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Declan Gavin was only 21 when he was stabbed to death outside the Abrakebabra fast food restaurant in Crumlin in August 2001.</p>\n<p>Rattigan was tried and convicted of murder, and sentenced to mandatory life in 2009.</p>\n<p>But he appealed the conviction all the way to the Supreme Court and won last December.</p>\n<p>The appeal was won on the basis that the trial judge had unintentionally engaged in advocacy that favoured the case of the prosecution.</p>\n<p>The court decided that the case should be retried and it was expected that the case would be heard in the new year.</p>\n<p>However, at a sitting of the Central Criminal Court yesterday Rattigan was arraigned, and when asked if he pleaded guilty or not guilty to murder he replied: \"Not guilty to murder, guilty to manslaughter\".</p>\n<p>Counsel for the prosecution told Judge Michael White that the guilty plea to manslaughter was being accepted by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>\n<p>Dressed in dark blue jeans, white trainers, and a blue and white striped jumper with red flashes on the sleeves, Rattigan stood and spoke clearly when pleading.</p>\n<p>Looking older, but fit and healthy, Rattigan, from Cooley Road in Drimnagh, had a neatly trimmed beard and neatly styled haircut, now greying, and wore glasses in court.</p>\n<p>He remains in prison having been convicted in 2013 of organising a €1m heroin deal from within prison. He was sentenced to 17 years, backdated to 2008. But he has also appealed that conviction and is awaiting judgment. </p>\n<p>His barrister, Brendan Grehan, said Rattigan wanted to say sorry to the Gavin family and anyone else hurt by his action.</p>\n<p>As he was being led from the court in the Criminal Courts of Justice, he looked towards the back of the room and gave a thumbs-up signal to somebody.</p>\n<p>The case is due back before the court for sentencing on December 20, when the Gavin family will have an opportunity to submit a victim impact statement. Members of the Gavin family were in court for yesterday's arraignment, sitting quietly on the opposite side to where Rattigan occupied the dock.</p>\n<p>They left without comment.</p>"
